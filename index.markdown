    <h6>Guage Chart</h6>
    <p>
    These gauges represent the distribution of Accelerator Labs across various thematic areas such as Cities, Circular Economy, Food Systems, and Civic Engagement. Each gauge displays a segmented arc, with "Low" values represented in red (0-10) and "High" values in green (10 and above). The pointer on each gauge indicates the number of labs working on the respective theme, while the number itself is prominently displayed in bold for easy identification. This visualization helps to quickly assess the focus and engagement levels across different thematic areas within the Accelerator Labs network.
